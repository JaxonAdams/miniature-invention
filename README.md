## Description
This website is an online invitation to my wife's baby shower for our second baby. It is a small MERN application. The front end was built using React, and the back end consists of a MongoDB database with the Mongoose ODM running on an Express server in Node. The website includes a form to RSVP, a countdown to my wife's due date, and a custom carousel of maternity photos. I can see who has RSVP'ed through the form by querying the /api endpoint in Insomnia or the browser.
